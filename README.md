# Archititecting IOT Solutions in Azure

Internet-of-things (IOT) is driving some compelling application scenarios in our industry that in turn result in new business opportunities.  It's also creating some challenges.  Smart devices and sensors are generating massive amounts of data in real-time.  How is this data ingested?  Where is it stored?  What are the services available to perform analytics on this data?  These challenges and patterns for addressing them are covered in this session.
